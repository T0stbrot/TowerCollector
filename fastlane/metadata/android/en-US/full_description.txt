Tower Collector gives you opportunity to contribute in OpenCellID.org and BeaconDB projects by uploading GPS locations of GSM/UMTS/LTE/CDMA/TD-SCDMA/5G (NR) cell towers from your area. The measurements help map the extent of mobile phone network coverage. You can use the app to collect data for personal purposes and export them to various files.

Some features:
• specially optimized GPS parameters to reduce battery drain
• upload to OpenCellID.org and BeaconDB projects
• export to SD card as CSV, JSON, GPX, KML and KMZ.
• ad-free, forever!

The OpenCellID.org project goal is to create a worldwide open source database of mobile cell locations. Tower Collector gives you opportunity to contribute in OpenCellID project by uploading cell towers locations from your area. Collected data can be used to quickly locate devices without enabling GPS.

BeaconDB is an a public database that collects location information about common wireless infrastructure (cell towers, WiFi access points, Bluetooth beacons). The cell tower data you contribute will be aggregated and released to the public under the "Creative Commons (CC-0)" license.
