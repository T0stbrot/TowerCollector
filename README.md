## Building
This project is build using Android Studio and Gradle.

To build your own signed apk go to "[app/properties](app/properties)" and:

 1. Place your keystore file inside the folder.
 2. Copy "[example.properties](app/properties/example.properties)" as "private.properties" in the same directory and adjust it accordingly.
 3. Copy "[google-services-example.json](app/google-services-example.json)" as "google-services.json" in the same directory and adjust it accordingly or place your own generated file there.
 4. These files will be ignored so don't worry about committing them by mistake.
